## LCD Notice Board

## Overview

This project implements a simple digital notice board using an Arduino Nano/Uno and a 16x2 I2C LCD display. The notice board can display custom messages and can be easily updated to show different announcements.

## Components Used

- **Arduino Nano/Uno**
- **16x2 I2C LCD Display**
- **Breadboard**
- **Jumper Wires**

## Wiring Instructions

### LCD Display (16x2 I2C)
- **VCC** -> 5V on Arduino
- **GND** -> GND on Arduino
- **SCL** -> A5 on Arduino Nano / Uno
- **SDA** -> A4 on Arduino Nano / Uno

## Features

- **Customizable Display**: The notice board can display two lines of text, which can be easily modified in the code.
- **Backlit LCD**: The LCD includes a backlight to ensure visibility in low-light conditions.
- **Simple Setup**: With I2C communication, the wiring for the LCD is minimal, making the setup easy and clean.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Wiring**: Connect the 16x2 I2C LCD display to the Arduino Nano/Uno as per the wiring instructions.
2. **Install Libraries**: You will need the `LiquidCrystal_I2C` library. Install it through the Arduino IDE's Library Manager by searching for "LiquidCrystal I2C."
3. **Upload Code**: Upload the provided code to your Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.
4. **Power Up**: Once the code is uploaded, power the Arduino via USB or external power.

## How It Works

- The Arduino initializes the 16x2 I2C LCD display and prints a welcome message followed by a custom message.
- You can modify the message by changing the text in the `lcd.print()` commands within the `setup()` function.
- The display can be used to show any announcements, making it ideal for digital notice boards in schools, offices, or homes.

## Customization

- **Message**: Change the text displayed on the LCD by modifying the content in `lcd.print()`.
- **Scrolling Text**: You can add scrolling text functionality by updating the `loop()` function and using the `lcd.scrollDisplayLeft()` or `lcd.scrollDisplayRight()` functions.
- **Dynamic Content**: You can extend the functionality by adding buttons or sensors to dynamically update the content on the LCD.

## Applications

- **School Notice Boards**: Display important information or announcements for students.
- **Office Notice Boards**: Share important updates, events, or reminders in the workplace.
- **Home Automation**: Use it to display notifications, weather updates, or other relevant information at home.
